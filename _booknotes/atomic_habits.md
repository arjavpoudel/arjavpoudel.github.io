#### Compound Interest

- If we get 1% better each day by the end of the year, we'll get x 37 better.
  But if we get 1% worse each day our skill levels will drop to almost 0 by end of the year
- Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it.

#### 4 problems with goal setting

1. Winners and losers have the same goals, therefore it can't be the goal itself that differentiates people.
2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. Temporary results. We should instead change the systems that caused those results in the first place.
3. Goals restrict happiness with the implicit assumption that 'once I reach the next goal, I'll be happy' results in continuously putting off happiness till the next 'milestone'
4. Goals are at odds with long-term-progress. Goals are milestones, systems are a way of life.

- Identity change is the most powerful way to implement a new habit.

#### Habits → Identity

- Your behaviours are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are – either consciously or non consciously
- Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- Whatever your identity is now, you only believe it because you have proof of it.
- Before marathon training, ask yourself: What would a marathon athlete do in this situation? eventually, by acting as a runner, you become one.

#### How to build a habit

1. Cue – triggers the brain to initiate action
2. Craving – provides a motivational force
3. Response – Action or habit we perform
4. Reward – End goal (what will inevitably cause us to repeat this action)

4 laws of behavior change
This how you build a habit and make it stick.

- Make it obvious.
  - Design your environment around your cues.
  - Put fewer steps between yourself and good behaviour and more steps between you and bad behaviour.
- Make it attractive.
  - Make the prospect of doing this task as enticing to you as possible
- Make it easy.
  - Prime your environment.
  - Friction is a powerful force – if you want to get into the habit of going to the gym in the morning, try taking your gym clothes out you sleep.
  - If you want to stick to playing the guitar, use (or buy) a stand and put your guitar on it in the room you most frequent during the day (either your bedroom or the living room).
  - Try tying habits you want to gain in with existing habits so that those habits provide a 'cue' to initiate the additional desired habit.
- Make it Satisfying.
  - Our brains have evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over long-term ones.
  - Akrasia is the hyperbolic discounting of tasks that don't provide immediate/short-term rewards.
  - Use positive reinforcement so that you will be more likely to repeat good actions in the future.
  - What is immediately rewarded is repeated.
  - What is immediately punished is avoided.

#### Misconceptions

- Most of us design outcome-based habits for ourselves when we should instead be focusing on identity change to really enforce the habits we want.
- Don't give yourself the chore of doing 100 pushups a day, give yourself further proof of your athletic identity by performing many pushups a day.
- Confirmation bias – we tend to believe and readily accept the facts which already support our worldview.
- Doing 100 pushups confirms we are athletic, therefore we are more likely to do it again. It has been ingrained in who we are. So we stick to it.
