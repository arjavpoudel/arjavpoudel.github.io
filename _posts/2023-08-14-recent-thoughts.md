The prolific artist on your left is not a sorcerer. The tech giant on your right is not a wizard. Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than society could sensibly expect.

The fact that PEMDAS exists gives a pretty strong indication that we way we frame things in life really does matter. The stories we tell ourselves have a cousin in logic.

Be comfortable knowing you know next to nothing; believing otherwise is nuclear ignorance. Just fail quickly, you’ll win faster.

Build a latticework for your worldview. If you want to understand something, always look at context first. See the forest, then the trees.

Matthew Dicks claims we are trained in life to tell bad stories because we usually tell those stories to our loved ones – the people with boundless tolerance for our mediocrity. I say a good story is celebrated. A great story is retold. But the best story is immortalised. And aren’t we all just tall tales in the end? Tell it right then.

Inspiration is temporary. If you don’t dive headfirst into a fiery mess of your own making, why light the spark? Don’t think too long, don’t think too hard. Just start, before common sense washes over and the creative flow stops dead.
