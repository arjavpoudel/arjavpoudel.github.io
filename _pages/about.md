# Projects

### ✍🏼 Nepali Handwritten Character Recognition Tool

- Developed a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks in PyTorch to recognise handwritten Nepali characters, achieving over 97% accuracy utilising a limited training dataset.

- Built a software tool with a real‑time handwriting recognition algorithm to showcase the model’s capabilities and release technology aimed to positively influence language learning and educational resources for underserved Nepali communities in the UK.
