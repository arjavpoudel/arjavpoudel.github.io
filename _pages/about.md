🎓 I'm a 3rd Year Undergraduate Student studying Artificial Intelligence at the University of
Edinburgh.

💡 I'm interested in Computer Vision, Reinforcement learning and Computational Neuroscience.

📝 I like to write about a lot of [things](https://arjavpoudel.github.io/year-archive/).

# 🤖 Projects

## ✍🏼 Nepali Handwritten Character Recognition Tool

- I developed a deep learning model using CNNs in PyTorch to recognise handwritten Nepali characters, achieving over 97% accuracyn whilst utilising a limited training dataset.
- Built a software tool with a real‑time handwriting recognition algorithm to showcase the model’s capabilities and release technology aimed to positively influence language learning and educational resources for underserved Nepali communities in the UK.

## 🧠 Brain‑Computer Interface Research

- Collaborated with the Human-Computer Interaction team at the University of St. Andrews to explore potential applications of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs).
- Conducted a comparative analysis of various BCI technologies, evaluating them based on key metrics such as neuronal recording scale, spatio-temporal resolution, and surgical invasiveness.
- Presented research findings as part of my Scottish Baccalaureate in Science, earning a Distinction and demonstrating strong research capabilities in the field of BCIs.

## 🧐 Professional Experience

Over Summer 2024, I worked as an ML Engineer Summer Intern at **UKAEA**, developing novel machine learning solutions for **experimental validation** in fusion technology, focusing on physics-informed approaches to predict discrepancies in tokamak divertor simulations. As Head of Computer Vision at **HumanEd**, I'm contributing to an advanced biomimetic hand project, using **computer vision** and **deep reinforcement learning** for autonomous Rubik's cube solving, building upon previous work by OpenAI to create a generalised infrastructure without specialised sensors.
