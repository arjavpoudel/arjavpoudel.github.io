🎓 I'm a 3rd Year Undergraduate Student studying Artificial Intelligence at the University of
Edinburgh.

💡 I'm interested in Computer Vision, Reinforcement learning and Computational Neuroscience.

📝 I like to write about a lot of things. Check out a few of my articles.

# Projects

## ✍🏼 Nepali Handwritten Character Recognition Tool

- I developed a deep learning model using CNNs in PyTorch to recognise handwritten Nepali characters, achieving over 97% accuracyn whilst utilising a limited training dataset.

- Built a software tool with a real‑time handwriting recognition algorithm to showcase the model’s capabilities and release technology aimed to positively influence language learning and educational resources for underserved Nepali communities in the UK.

## 🧠 Brain‑Computer Interface Research

- Collaborated with the Human-Computer Interaction team at the University of St. Andrews to explore potential applications of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs).
- Conducted a comparative analysis of various BCI technologies, evaluating them based on key metrics such as neuronal recording scale, spatio-temporal resolution, and surgical invasiveness.
- Presented research findings as part of my Scottish Baccalaureate in Science, earning a Distinction and demonstrating strong research capabilities in the field of BCIs.
