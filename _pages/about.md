🎓 I'm in my 3rd Year studying BSc AI at the University of Edinburgh. I'm interested in Computer Vision, NLP, Reinforcement learning and Computational Neuroscience.

📝 I write about [things](https://arjavpoudel.github.io/year-archive/) from time to time.

# 🤖 Projects

## ✍🏼 Nepali Handwritten Character Recognition Tool

- I developed a deep learning model using CNNs in PyTorch to recognise handwritten Nepali characters, achieving over 97% accuracyn whilst utilising a limited training dataset.
- Built a software tool with a real‑time handwriting recognition algorithm to showcase the model’s capabilities and release technology aimed to positively influence language learning and educational resources for underserved Nepali communities in the UK.

## 🧠 Brain‑Computer-Interfaces

- I Collaborated with the Human-Computer Interaction team at the University of St. Andrews to explore potential applications of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs).
- We conducted a comparative analysis of various BCI technologies, evaluating them based on key metrics such as neuronal recording scale, spatio-temporal resolution, and surgical invasiveness.
- I presented research findings as part of my Scottish Baccalaureate in Science, earning a Distinction and demonstrating strong research capabilities in the field of BCIs.

## 🧐 Professional Experience

Over Summer 2024, I worked as an ML Engineer Summer Intern at **UKAEA**, developing novel machine learning solutions for **experimental validation** within fusion technology, focusing on physics-informed approaches to predict discrepancies in tokamak divertor monoblock simulations. As Head of Computer Vision at **HumanEd**, We're combining **computer vision** and **deep reinforcement learning** to build a biomimetic hand for autonomous Rubik's cube solving, building upon previous work by OpenAI to create a generalised infrastructure (but thois time without any specialised sensors).
